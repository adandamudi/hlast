# Hindsight Logging Across Space and Time

## Run diff-match-patch
Here's an example command that should Just Workâ„¢
```
python dmp-propagate.py --in-dir tests/toy-simple --log-version 2 --out-dir out/dmp/toy-simple --log=DEBUG
```

## Testing
Pass in two different directories with the same filenames, and the test harness will compare their log outputs:
```
VERBOSE=1 ./test-harness.sh tests/toy-simple/v1-gt results/dmp/toy-simple/v1
```

(you can turn off VERBOSE if you want less output)

## Data Format
Data is organized as follows (see `tests/toy-simple/`):
```
tests/{{codebase name}}/v{{version number in (1,...)}}/{{filename}}.py
```
e.g.
* codebase name: `toy-simple`
* version numbers 1, 2 (these should always be numeric and descending)
* filename (this can be whatever) `linear-regression-example.py`

If you want to propagate a log backwards from, say, `v4`
It's expected that their is also a corresponding directory that contains the log named `v4-log`. Again, look at `tests/toy-simple/`


(you can turn off VERBOSE if you want less output)

## GumTree Installation (old: this gumtree apparently does not work for python)

```
# setup a conda environment
conda create -n 262a python=3.7 ipython
conda activate 262a

# install pythonparser for gumtree
git clone git@github.com:GumTreeDiff/pythonparser.git
cd pythonparser
pip install -r requirements.txt
ln -f -s $PWD/pythonparser  SOMEWHERE_IN_YOUR_PATH


# install java (you may have a different setup on your system)
conda install -c anaconda openjdk 

# get gumtree binary
wget https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree/releases/download/v2.1.2/gumtree.zip
unzip gumtree.zip
ln -s $PWD/gumtree-2.1.2/bin/gumtree SOMEWHERE_IN_YOUR_PATH

# test
gumtree diff file1 file2
```
